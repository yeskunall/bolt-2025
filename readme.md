[Production deployment](https://loquacious-pothos-903ba4.netlify.app/)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This application uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) for data persistence. Please make sure you don’t disable access to your local storage.

tl;dr (as written by Bolt):

Here’s a summary of the tech stack:

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: Fast build tool and development server.
- TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for type safety.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- `window.localStorage`: Browser API for client-side data persistence.

Our conversation has focused on developing and refining a todo list application.

Initially, we established the core requirements for the app, including CRUD operations, priority levels, a two-tab interface, and persistence using localStorage.

We then proceeded with a significant refactoring, where we:

- Renamed `use-local-storage-todos.ts` to `use-local-storage.ts` and made it a generic hook solely for persistence, including error handling.
- Renamed `use-todo-management.ts` to `use-todos.ts` and moved all todo-specific CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and toggle functionality into this hook.
- Updated `app.tsx` to reflect these changes, maintaining the UI tab logic there.

Most recently, we improved the UI by removing the redundant priority dot from the todo-item component, as the priority pill already effectively conveys the information.

Throughout these steps, the application has been successfully deployed to Netlify after each major change.

Initial prompt:

I want to build a todo list app. There’s no need for any auth(entication|orization), but it does need a persistence layer so it can remember the todo list items. Plus, as a user, I should be able to:
- create todos
- edit todos
- delete todos
- assign a priority to my todos (low, medium, high) + the UI should reflect the priority of the todo
- todos can be marked as completed; when they are, they should move to a “completed page,” separate from the existing todos --- my suggestion is to create 2 tabs: one for existing todos, one for completed todos

You already have your scaffolding and tech stack chosen for you (React + Vite & Tailwind)

Few things to remember:
- when creating new files, use kebab-case ONLY
- do not go overboard with styling or any advanced features not mentioned above, and wherever possible opt-in to the Grug Brained Developer style of coding
- at this stage, feel free to use the browser’s `localStorage` as the persistence layer; create a dedicated hook for this, and place in its own `hooks/` folder
- create types for (prefer `interface` over `type`) the “todo” as well as actions that can be performed on the todo, namely: `CreateTodoInput` and `UpdateTodoInput`; also a type `Priority` that only allows the 3 types mentioned above (I’ll let you decide what TS built-in to use here)

<p>

You are a React developer tasked with building a todo list application. Create a complete, functional todo app using the specified requirements and constraints below.

**Tech Stack & Setup:**
- React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (already scaffolded)
- Use browser localStorage for persistence

**Core Features Required:**
1. Create new todos
2. Edit existing todos  
3. Delete todos
4. Assign priority levels (low, medium, high) with visual indicators in UI
5. Mark todos as completed
6. Two-tab interface: "Active Todos" and "Completed Todos"

**Technical Requirements:**

**File Naming:** Use kebab-case ONLY for all new files

**TypeScript Interfaces:** Create these interfaces (prefer `interface` over `type`):
- `Todo` - main todo object structure
- `CreateTodoInput` - for creating new todos
- `UpdateTodoInput` - for editing todos  
- `Priority` - union type restricting to "low" | "medium" | "high"

**Persistence:** 
- Create a custom hook for localStorage operations
- Place in dedicated `hooks/` folder
- Handle all CRUD operations through this hook

**Code Style:**
- Follow "Grug Brained Developer" principles (simple, straightforward code)
- Minimal styling - focus on functionality over aesthetics
- No advanced features beyond the specified requirements
- Keep components simple and focused

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Complete file structure with all necessary components
- Working localStorage persistence hook
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Functional two-tab interface
- Priority-based visual indicators
- Full CRUD operations for todos

Provide the complete implementation including all files, their contents, and folder structure.

1st run:

It did almost exactly as it was told to. Except it made a mistake where it failed to persist the todos on refresh. I gave it some guidance and it was able to fix it in one run.

Hint:

There’s a bug right now where the stored todos in localStorage are wiped out whenever the app is refreshed. I believe the issue is that the 2nd useEffect in use-local-storage-todos.ts is running on every render. Can you fix it so that the todos are persisted on refresh?

After this, I deployed the 1st run to Netlify.

2nd run:

Back to **Discussion Mode**:

Let’s go back to our plan to refactor things a little. I want you to call the `use-todo-management.ts` hook just `use-todos.ts` instead. I also want you to rename `use-local-storage-todos.ts` to simply `use-local-storage.ts`. Make sure you update imports correctly wherever required.

Inside `use-todos.ts` you should move all the CRUD functionality associated with a todo (and do not forget toggling its state (active or completed) either!) from `use-local-storage.ts`. This will allow your `use-local-storage` hook to simply handle persistence, and nothing else. Add proper error handling in case you cannot access or add to `localStorage`.

I think it is OK to keep the UI logic for updating the current tab in app.tsx for now so don’t add it to `use-todos.ts`.

Everything make sense?

After it agreed, I told Bolt to implement the refactoring plan. It was successful.

After this, I deployed the 2nd run to Netlify.

3rd run:

In **Discussion mode**:

This is really good stuff. The refactored version also seems to work in production.

One thing I think we can improve UI-wise. Currently, the `todo-item` renders both a dot AND a pill (or badge) for the priority of the todo item. Since the pill already effectively communicates the priority of the todo item, I think we should remove the logic that handles (and renders) the priority dot. Do you agree?

After it agreed, I asked Bolt to make the changes, which it did correctly.

I deployed these changes to Netlify next.
